I let all youth_teams play the same
way, like the first_team. I always
put the emhasis on learning.
Something I had the suspicion
that youth_coaches were more
concerned with winning. They
cared about their own reputation.
Me, I cared only about the interest
of the club. When a player with talent
couldn't defend, I put him in defense
so he could learn, but that could cost
a point? I didn't care, I was busy 
developing the player.
